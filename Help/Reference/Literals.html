The following sections describe the types of literals that can be represented.
<h2>Numbers</h2>
<h3>Integers</h3>
<p>An integer is any series of digits optionally preceeded by a minus sign:
<pre>
    -13      
    666      
    2112      
    96
</pre>
<h3>Floats</h3>
<p>A float is one or more decimal digits followed by a decimal point followed by one or more decimal digits. 
You must have digits on both sides of the decimal point.  This distinguishes floating point numbers from 
integer expressions like <code>8.rand</code>
.
<p>Examples of floats:
<pre>
    0.39      
    98.6      
    1.0      
    -0.5
</pre>
<p>Exponential notation is also supported:
<pre>
    1.2e4
    1e-4
</pre>
<p>The constant pi can be appended to a number to create a floating point constant:
<pre>
    2pi    
    0.5pi
    -0.25pi
</pre>
<h3>Radix</h3>
<p>Numbers can also be written in radices other than base 10 up to base 36. 
The radix is specified in base 10 followed by the letter 'r' followed by the value written in
that radix using characters 0-9,A-Z, or a-z, for digit values from 0 to 35. 
For example you can write hexidecimal numbers as follows:
<pre>
    16rF0
    16rA9FF
</pre>
<p>Binary numbers can be written as follows:
<pre>
    2r01101011
</pre>
<p>be specified in any also be specified in any base:
<pre>
    12r4A.A
</pre>
<h2>Characters</h2>
<p>Characters are preceeded by a dollar sign:
<pre>
    $A     
    $B     
    $C
</pre>
<p>Tab, linefeed, carriage return, and backslash are preceeded by a backslash:
<pre>
    $\t
    $\n
    $\r
    $\\
</pre>
<h2>Symbols </h2>
<p>A symbol is written as a string enclosed in single quotes. 
examples of symbols:
<pre>
    'x'
    'aiff'
    'BigSwiftyAndAssoc'
    'nowhere here'  
    'somewhere there' 
    '.+o*o+.'
</pre>
<p>A symbol consisting of a single word can be written with a preceeding backslash.
<pre>
    \x
    \aiff
    \BigSwiftyAndAssoc
</pre>
<h2>Strings</h2>
<p>Strings are written in double quotes:
<pre>
    "This is a string."
</pre>
<p>are lexically adjacent, then strings are lexically adjacent, then they combine into a larger string:
<pre>
    "This" " is " "also a " "string."
</pre>
<p>Strings may span more than one line. If so, then the new line characters become part of the string:
<pre>
"This
is 
also a
string.
"
</pre>
<p>	
<h2>Identifiers </h2>
<p>Names of methods and variables begin with a lower case alphabetic character, followed by zero or more
alphanumeric characters:
<pre>
    var abc, z123, func;
</pre>
<h2>Class Names</h2>
<p>Class names always begin with a capital letter followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters.
<pre>
    Object
    Point
    Synth
</pre>
<h2>Special Values</h2>
<p>The singular instances of the classes True, False and Nil are written as the 
words true, false, nil and inf.
<pre>
    x = true;
    y = false;
    z = nil;
</pre>
<h2>Arrays</h2>
<a href="../Classes/Array.html">Array</a>s of literals are created at compile time and are written with a # preceeding the array as follows:
<pre>
    #[1, 2, 'abc', "def", 4]
</pre>
<p>Literal Arrays must be used as is and may not be altered at run time.
<p>In literal Arrays names are interpreted as symbols. This is not the case in regular Arrays, where they are interpreted as variable names:
<pre>
    #[foo, bar]	// this is legal; an Array of Symbols
    [foo, bar]	// this is only legal if foo and bar have been declared as variables
</pre>
<p>Arrays and other collections may also be created dynamically which is explained in <a href="../Classes/Collection.html">Collection</a>.
Using a literal Array is faster than building an array dynamically every time you need it.
<p>When nesting literal arrays, only the outermost literal array needs the '#' character.
<pre>
    #[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
</pre>
<p>Literal Arrays can be useful for things such as tables of constants, for example note names:
<pre>
(
// build a table of note names
var table = ();
value {
    var semitones = [0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11];
    var naturalNoteNames = ["c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "a", "b"];

    (0..9).do {|o|
        naturalNoteNames.do {|c, i|
            var n = (o + 1) * 12 + semitones[i];
            table[(c ++ o).asSymbol] = n;
            table[(c ++ "s"  ++ o).asSymbol] = n + 1;
            table[(c ++ "ss" ++ o).asSymbol] = n + 2;
            table[(c ++ "b"  ++ o).asSymbol] = n - 1;
            table[(c ++ "bb" ++ o).asSymbol] = n - 2;
        };
    };
};

// translate note names to midi keys
table.atAll(#[c4, e4, gs4, c5, e5, gs5, c6])
)
</pre>
