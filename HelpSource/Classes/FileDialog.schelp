categories:: GUI>Accessories
related:: Classes/Dialog, Classes/File

DESCRIPTION::
This is the interface for your standard operating system modal file dialogs to open files, save files and select directories.

See also Dialog which makes it a bit simpler without the need to set fileMode and acceptMode manually.

At the moment selecting a directory is only possible with FileDialog.

CLASSMETHODS::

PRIVATE:: qtClass

METHOD:: new
Open a modal dialog

ARGUMENT:: okFunc
handler function for: user selected a file and clicked ok.
Argument to the function is either a single path, an array of paths, or multiple paths passed in as separate arguments.
This depends on what fileMode and stripResult were specified.

ARGUMENT:: cancelFunc
handler function for: user cancelled

ARGUMENT:: fileMode
Integer

Determines the type of dialog.

list::
## 0			QFileDialog AnyFile		     The name of a file, whether it exists or not.
## 1			QFileDialog ExistingFile	   The name of a single existing file.
## 2			QFileDialog Directory		   The name of a directory. Both files and directories are displayed.
## 3			QFileDialog ExistingFiles	 The names of zero or more existing files.
::

0 or 3 implies that the user can type in a new file name.

ARGUMENT:: acceptMode
Integer
This determines what the accept button says: "Open" or "Save"

list::
## 0			QFileDialog AcceptOpen
## 1			QFileDialog AcceptSave
::

ARGUMENT:: stripResult
If selecting multiple files (using fileMode 3) then you have the choice of having your okFunc called with a list or with each of the paths as separate items.

If you want to select only one item then use stripResult = true so that your okFunc will be passed the item instead of a list.

list::
## true: okFunc(path1, path2, path3)
## false: okFunc(paths)
::

ARGUMENT:: path
A string. The dialog will initially display the contents of this path. The default is the current
user's home directory.

returns:: a FileDialog

EXAMPLES::

code::
// By default, the selected paths are passed to okFunc as an array.
FileDialog({ |paths|
	postln("Selected path:" + paths[0]);
	}, {
	postln("Dialog was cancelled. Try again.");
	});

// You can change this by passing `stripResult: true`
FileDialog({ |path|
	postln("Selected path:" + path);
	}, {
	postln("Dialog was cancelled. Try again.");
	}, stripResult: true);

// Passing `fileMode: 3` makes it possible to select multiple files.
FileDialog({ |paths|
	postln("Selected paths:);
	paths.do(_.postln);
	}, fileMode: 3);

// Passing `fileMode: 0` allows selecting any kind of file.
// You can start the dialog in a directory other than home by passing `path: "/some/path/"`
FileDialog({ |path|
	postln("Selected file:" + path);
	postln("File type is:" + File.type(path)); },
	fileMode: 0,
	stripResult: true,
	path: Platform.userAppSupportDir);
